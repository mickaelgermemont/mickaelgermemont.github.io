Since i upgraded to OSX High Sierra, i noticed some problems with icons. I see the default icon instead of the app icon. 

It happens in the Application folder, the Dock, command+tab and even Launchpad

![Screenshot OSX icon issue Dock]({{ "/assets/2018-01-29-osx-high-sierra-issue-with-icons/ScreenShot_OSX_IconIssue_Dock.png" | absolute_url }})

![Screenshot OSX icon issue Launchpad]({{ "/assets/2018-01-29-osx-high-sierra-issue-with-icons/ScreenShot_OSX_IconIssue_Launchpad.jpg" | absolute_url }})

i am looking for a solution. i googled and found some helpful links.

EDIT: I saw this thread and suggest people try to safe boot then reboot, which should work.
